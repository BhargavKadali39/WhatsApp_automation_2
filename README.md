WhatsApp automation using python module.

This repo shows how to automate most of your works in WhatsApp.

The name of the module is pywhatkit and this is the command to install it 

    pip install pywhatkit
    
This module is one of my favorites and the reason behind is that,
using this single module we can just throw away some small module that I've previously used, like [wikipedia](https://github.com/BhargavKadali39/Wikipedia-in-pyton)
Google search, YouTube topic searching, text to handwriting and much more!!
